        Note: Please do not read the About Us page out loud. You will hurt yourself trying to pronounce our last names.

ZenMaid was started in 2013 by Amar Ghose and Arun Devabhaktuni of Palo Alto, CA. 

Amar previously ran a highly successful maid service in Orange County, CA. Due to his full time job his focus as operations manager from Day 1 was to run the maid service on minimal time. Instant online booking, a well organized automatic calendar and reminder system for both employees and customers allowed him to do just that in under 30 minutes per day. 

It was obvious from the start that the edge he had on the competition was due to his maid management software and Arun was swiftly brought on board to help make this widely available to maid services around the world.
